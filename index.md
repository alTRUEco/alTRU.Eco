## alTRUE Toolkit
##### **`alTRUE`** is a **toolkit** to solve _Scarcity_ in _Local Communities_.
Individuals, communities, and organizations can create _P2P marketplaces_ using the _alTRUE Toolkit_ to sell/exchange/gift goods & services.
1. Running an _alTRUE_ instance, you can create _peer-to-peer marketplaces_.
2. The _open-source_[^FLOSS] marketplace supports the sale, exchange, or gift of goods and services.
3. The uploaded _goods and services_ are stored and managed with a **resource management toolkit**, using _encrypted data_ and _anonymized identity management_ `tbd.`
4. Supporting _Sharing Economy_ is the basic concept of the _alTRUE_ ecosystem.
5. _Decentralized Sharing Economy_ is the key to solving _Scarcity_ in **local communities**.
6. The _distributed network_ of _local communities_ is building up the _Sharing Economy_ backed by its _resource management_, _trusted marketplace_, and [_the three ethics of Permaculture_](https://permacultureprinciples.com/ethics/ "Earth care, People care and Fair share")
